# OpenCV_Projects

This repository includes any projects that I have completed in research, projects, or [online classes (Rajeev Ratan)](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/). My main focus is to study fields that cross over Machine Learning (Convolutionary Neural Network, Support Vector Machines, and Clustering of K-means), Computer Vision and Data Science.
